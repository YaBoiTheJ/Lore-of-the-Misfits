[[The Bürarch Empire]]
According to legend, this body of water first formed on the spot where [[Aurelia]]’s first disciple struck the ground with her spear to create a spring. The miraculous water gave life to what once was barren land. Today, the sprawling city of [[Altenheim]] sits at the edge of this lake.

When the goddess [[Aurelia]] fell to Earth, most of her body was burned away by her descent. What remained was her head, which fell into Lake Osea. Today, her gigantic stone face rests at the bottom of the sacred Lake, where it can barely be seen through the murky waters.

According to legend, the water of Lake Osea was once capable of healing diseases and injuries, but no one would attempt to consume it now. The [[Hearthkeepers]] have declared it holy ground and have forbidden anyone from approaching the lake itself.
