[[Nordenland]]
Meanwhile, East Nordenland draws magic entirely from the natural world. The capital city of [[Ulmirac]] houses the [[Order of the Golden Bough]]. Potions, ingredients, and herbs of all kinds may be found in the [[Silverine Market]].

Alfric, Patriarch of the Oaken Circle, maintains order while encouraging his citizens to live in harmony with the natural world. Thus, the Circle maintains protective magical boundaries on the forests of East Nordenland, but even these are failing due to the power of the Great Beast.
