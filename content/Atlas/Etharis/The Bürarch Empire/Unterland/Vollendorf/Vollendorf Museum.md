write more about this and include the coffee shop lol

## Library 
A bit sparse in terms of more sought after tomes but still maintains many of the nations greatest works. One requires permission to enter the library, or have a valid School I.D.
## Mean Mug, Coffee Shop
A brilliant idea to influence more persons into using the Museum/Library, the Coffee shop has actually brought in profit to an otherwise totally tax funded establishment. 

## Info on the Profesor
[[Professor Jamenas Elorin]] had relinquished is most prized archeological find to this museum. The [[Lux Channel]] he had discovered 18 years prior was in near mint condition when he found it. Due to some financial errors he decided to hand it over to a learning institution so he wouldn't make any poor decisions to sell it. 

The professor disappeared 3 months later when he had made an appointment to see his old artefact. Apparently some troubling discovery had been made about them, [[Lux Channel]]s, and he had wanted to verify whether they could be true. **The Curator and Antiquities Manager at the museum, Anabelle Grimskal,** wanted to question him further when he arrived, yet he never did. As a professor, he travelled light and without traditional security measures and was apparently attacked on the road outside of town. No one knows what became of him.
