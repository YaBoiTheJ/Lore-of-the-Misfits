## History
Olstenberg started out as the camp grounds for Imperial armies mustering for war. Geographically it was a set of low hills in [[The Bürarch Empire]]. Wells had to be dug and resources had to be brought to location as their was no infrastructure for food supply. Over the centuries, instead of hauling their resources to location they eventually developed the land to start producing the resources it could.

## Valuables/Resources

Their biggest yield is in animal husbandry, and crop production with their large open spaces and huge tracks of land. Their weapon smiths are renowned but are imported from the surrounding areas.

## Layout 
Olstenberg is a major settlement and is quite expansive. Once, simply a field where great armies mustered to march on foes, now is one of the most defensible cities in the Bürach. 

Olstenberg's castle-keep sits on top of a hill and is surrounded by the rest of the city. 

The outer city limits are devoid of tall vegetation or large terrain giving the watchtowers of the city miles of visibility to see encroaching forces or hordes of monsters. There are equal amounts of farmland and training fields where soldiers and students of the [[Academy of Swords]] drill for combat.
