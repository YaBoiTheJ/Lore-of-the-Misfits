[[The Valikan Tribes]]
Northeast of the mainland lies a group of volcanic islands that serve to imprison a host of fire elementals.

In ancient times, the sorceress Rune aided the Seven Heroes in taming the wilds. Among the holdouts of the [[primordials]] was an army of fire elementals under the banner of Ixlalu, a salamander of great power. However, Rune discovered that Ixlalu’s magic staff was the true source of his power. She stole it from his vault and used it to curse their entire island, turning it into a prison that would hold them captive for thousands of years.

Of late, Rune’s curse appears to be weakening. Fire elementals have been seen testing the boundaries of the island, searching for a way out.
