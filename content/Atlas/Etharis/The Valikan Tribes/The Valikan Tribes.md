# The Valikan Clans
#realms

**Languages**: Imperial Norm, Valikan and its dialects
**Currency**: Bürach Crown, barter trade


FAR TO THE NORTH, AT THE FROZEN EDGE OF the continent, lies [[Grarjord]], the homeland of the Valikan. Each day, the hardy folk who dwell there face the dangers of the elements, the harshness of their faiths, and numerous wars fought in the name of their beliefs. Life is short among the Great Clans.

[[Grarjord]], the northernmost province of Etharis, is a land of pines, tundras, glaciers, and the forbidding cold. To survive the warring Valikans must fight not just each other but the unforgiving environment, rampaging elementals, and the ongoing threat of coldfire. Since the Schism, the six Valikan Clans have been divided into two nations: [[Thrull]] and [[Kandar]]. Both of these factions are in a deadlock for control of [[Grarjord]].

## Clans at a Glance
The realm of Valika is shaped politically by its six clans, all of whom are named after a legendary hero who followed Kentigern
into battle against Gormadraug, the Prismatic Wyrm, in
mythic times. These clans are described briefly here and are
described in greater detail in Raider’s Guide to Valika.

- Clan [[Rune]]. Rune prizes magic, unlike many of the other clans, for they were founded by the sorceress who lent the clan her name. Magic is at the heart of this clan’s life, and the telltale signs of magic can be seen in their architecture, fortifications, and even food. They are a Thrull clan.
- Clan [[Sýr]]. Named after the infamous weaponsmith Sýr the Seven-Bladed, the people of Sýr follow her virtues of self-determination, combat prowess, and metallurgical mastery. They are a Thrull clan.
- Clan [[Völgr]]. The people of Völgr embody the stereotypical image of a Valikan raider, fearsome, bloody warriors who go on savage raids. The Völgr enjoy a brutal reputation even among the Valikan clans. They are a Thrull clan, and their city of Tyburn is the seat of power in Thrull.
- Clan [[Mithra]]. Named in honor of the legendary bard Mithra of the Silver Harp, this clan is not only welcoming toward outsiders but is also the cosmopolitan heart of the Kandar region. The clan embraces merchants, travelers, and diplomats from across Etharis. They are a Kandar clan, and the great city of Hrist is the seat of power for the Kandar province.
- Clan [[Morgöng]]. Clan Morgöng is best known for its spies, who are rumored to be in every court in Etharis. Morgöng spies take advantage of the brutish, bloodthirsty image southerners hold about the Valikan people; it makes the Morgöng unlikely suspects when rumors of espionage surface. They are a Kandar clan.
- Clan [[Limgri]]. Named after Limgri Lightbringer, a devotee of the sun god, this clan stands as a dour bastion against the dangerous land of Volgen, which burns with cold fire. This clan has accepted that the world is to end, and that their task is to postpone that apocalypse as long as possible. Others, however, see the end as something as beautiful and natural as the setting sun, and welcome its timely arrival. They are a Kandar clan.

## Landscape
The six clans of the Valikan subsist in one of the harshest regions in the world. The southernmost part of [[Grarjord]] is still temperate, holding vast pine forests bounded by snow-covered mountains. Beyond the forests stretches the tundra known as the [[Pale March]]. Minor tribes survive here, hunting reindeer and other wild game.

At the northern edge of the [[Pale March]] lies a restless ice sea where dwell leviathans and other deadly creatures. Further northeast, closest to the North Pole, is [[Volgen]], a frozen land where originates a strange and deadly phenomenon known as coldfire. In recent years, the coldfire crisis has connected [[Volgen]] to the mainland via an icy land bridge.
