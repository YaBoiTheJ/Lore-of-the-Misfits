[[Runeheim]]
One block from [[The Drowned Bridge]], one can find an alley stuck between high dilapidated buildings. Almost every day, a market is held there, allowing those who have a few coins left to buy spoiled food and other articles that merchants want to get rid of. Rats are everywhere in the Pit, and it’s not unusual to find a dead one “included” in the merchandise. That’s why many people call the place the Dead Rat Market.
