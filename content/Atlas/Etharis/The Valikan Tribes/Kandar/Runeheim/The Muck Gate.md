[[Runeheim]]
Across the square from [[The Sticky Stew]], a huge gate blocks entrance to the rough area called the Pit. That gate once was magnificent, but decades of neglect have uglied it to the point that it is now called the Muck Gate. The name also suits it because all the towns filth, thrown into the river running through it, backs up beside the gate until the sluice is periodically opened, releasing the flow on into the Pit. The Muck Gate is only opened during the day, and it is constantly guarded by a group of 4 guards led by Lieutenant Doze, a huge scarred warrior built like a brick wall.
