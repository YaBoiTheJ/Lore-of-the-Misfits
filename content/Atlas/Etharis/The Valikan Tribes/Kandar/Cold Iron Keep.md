In the North East of [[Kandar]], high in the Jakkan mountain range, lies a castle that serves as the prison for [[Kandar]]’s most dangerous druids, criminals, and madmen.

Cold Iron Keep was first raised from the stones of Jakkan by the evil mage Mordu. From there, he preyed on the local populace and traveling merchants, sacrificing hundreds of innocents to otherworldly beings in his bid for power. Eventually, he was overthrown by heroes. The locals ransacked his castle but otherwise left it intact. Cold Iron Keep stayed empty for many years until it was appropriated by the leaders of [[Kandar]] and converted into a prison.

Numbered among the Keep’s inmates are: [[Jormund]], a unique vampire frost giant who is shunned even among his own kind. He is kept in a state of torpor inside a quartz coffin while mages from [[Kandar]] study his condition.

[[Astar]], a powerful sorceress who, in the process of trying to achieve unearthly beauty, caused her features to become so unspeakably hideous that one look can turn a person into solid stone. She is forced to wear an iron mask while she is incarcerated.

[[Rivien]], a cultist who appears to have gained the ability to steal a person’s face and absorb their life essence.

[[Sumac]], a man whose very words are poison—who can kill another just by speaking and force others to do his bidding.
