[[The Valikan Tribes]]
On the western edge of the great tundra is a perpetually frozen lake, at the heart of which stands a great fortress of ice. This is Frostmere, the stronghold of the [[Melwarg]], frost giants led by [[King Olag]].

The [[Melwarg]] are not natives to Grarjord, but exiles from across the western sea who searched for lands to claim as their own. From Frostmere, they raid [[Kandar]] and have been known on occasion to join [[Thrull]] war parties.

Unlike the elementals, the [[Melwarg]] do not wish for the return of the [[Gormadraug]] and do anything in their power to suppress its worship. They have declared themselves mortal enemies of the Cult of the Great Wyrm and attack its members on sight.
