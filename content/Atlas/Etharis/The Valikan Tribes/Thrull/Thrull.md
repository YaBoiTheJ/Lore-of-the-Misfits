**Ruler**: The Prismatic Circle; Chief Nolgr Magnusson

Within western [[Grarjord]] lies the land of Thrull, a forbidding land dotted with icy peaks and frozen forests. While the land shows hints of green from afar, its soil is of poor quality for farming. Thus those who live there feed themselves the only way they can—by taking from other lands. Upon the island of Holgar lies their capital, the harbor city of [[Tyburn]], a central port for longships.

To this day, the people of Grarjord fear [[Gormadraug]], the legendary Prismatic Wyrm that sleeps in the northern oceans and whose waking could bring about the end of the world. An order of druids known as the Prismatic Circle dedicate themselves to stopping this from happening. Through sacrifices of blood and war, they believe they can prevent the awakening of Gormadraug, and thus keep the world safe. Three Valikan tribes—[[Rune]], [[Sýr]], and [[Völgr]]—supported this belief, forming the theocratic province of Thrull.

## History 
Three clans settled on the island of Holgar: the Rune, who embody elemental magic best; the [[Sýr]], great metalsmiths; and the [[Völgr]], a warrior society. Though the three feuded time and again over land and grazing rights, they generally maintained cooperative ties with each other.

The disappearance of Thorgard, left the clans with a power vacuum. Warlords immediately began vying for control of [[Grarjord]]. But one individual took a different course. On Holgar, an elemental druid named Kybard gained power by advocating a strange belief: that [[Gormadraug]] still lives but sleeps beneath the earth and sea. Should it awaken, it would bring about the end of the world. To keep it in slumber, the Valikan must follow the time-honoured traditions of Thorgard: war, raiding, and bloodshed.

Though originally met with opposition, Kybard’s teachings found adherents among the clan leaders. The three largest clans—the Rune, the Sýr, and the Völgr—joined together under Kybard’s banner and called their province Thrull.

Of the three great clans, Clan [[Rune]] is the most adept at magic, creating runestones that store spells that they can activate during combat. Their chief, Ordun, remains outwardly loyal to the Prismatic Circle but is intent on pursuing independence from their rule.

Clan [[Sýr]] is focused on expanding their economy, and has heavily invested in slaves to man their forges. Their weaponsmithing is famous throughout Grarjold.

Finally, Clan [[Völgr]] is the most loyal to the Prismatic Druids. They regularly provide captives, slaves, and criminals as human sacrifices for the Circle’s rituals. At times, the rivers of the land run red with the blood of these victims.

## Politics and Leadership
Thrull is a province ruled by druids, who maintain a spiritual link with the primordial forces of the world. While the three chieftains of the clans maintain some independence, they generally bow to the will of the Prismatic Circle, making Thrull a de facto theocracy.

The people of Thrull regularly raid other settlements outside their lands, particularly those in [[Kandar]]. The druids ritually sacrifice slaves and captives beneath sacred trees, all to deepen the slumber of the Great Wyrm. Travelers from Thrull tell gruesome stories of forests where skinned and gutted men hang from the boughs of ancient oaks.

At this time, the leader of the clans is Chief Nolgr Magnusson of the Völgr, Keeper of the Three Tribes. Magnusson enjoys the approval of the Circle, and cannot be easily dislodged from his position through force of arms alone. A warmonger, Magnusson is more interested in earthly rewards and regularly sends raiding parties to attack [[Kandar]] towns and cities.

## Economy
Most of the Thrull economy is derived from their traditions of raiding and slavery. The Thrull have perfected the art of raiding: longboats carry small contingents of warriors aided by druids. The druids command the tides to carry the ships swiftly through the sea, and allowing them to approach their victims under cover of fog. Etharian ships and ports have learned to fear the coming of the sea mists.

Fishing, hunting, smithing, and whaling round off the list of the Thrull industries. Trade is kept within the three clans: the [[Rune]] produce elixirs and enchanted runestones, the [[Sýr]] forge weapons, shields, and armour, and the [[Völgr]] train fighters. A black market exists for trading with other nations, but this practice is forbidden by the druids, who want to maintain the Thrull’s isolationist stance.

## Notable Individuals
**Hjadana** — The Grand Druid of the Prismatic Circle, spiritual leader of the Thrull people, and the true power behind the government, Hjadana truly believes that their way of living is saving the world from a great menace. Thus she exhorts each chief to continue the war against any who stand against them.

The Grand Druid dwells within a hollow hill, surrounded by a fortress composed of living oak trees. Within this sacred area, she can command air and earth elementals to aid her.

Hjadana sees the Coldfire Crisis as a sign that the Great Wyrm is almost awake, and thus she commands all the clans to intensify their raids and sacrifices.

**Lief Sarvif** — Once a slave, Lief killed his master rather than allow himself to be sold to the druids for ritual sacrifice. He then fled into the wilds where, as luck would have it, he was bitten by a werewolf.

Lief soon learned to control his own inner beast. Freeing other slaves, he created a pack of werewolves and settled on a small island southwest of the mainland. He has since built a small army from rescued slaves and other likeminded individuals. Twenty times the Thrull clans have sent a warlord to put down his rebellion and that many warlords have died in the attempt. Lief has declared his sanctuary free of the Prismatic Circle’s influence.

While he holds no love for the Kandarians, Lief is shrewd enough to use their help to maintain his personal war. To date, he has opened channels with the [[Redclaws]] faction in [[Kandar]] for a mutual defense treaty.

**Grenhildr** — Any theocracy eventually creates its own nemesis, and so it is for the Prismatic Circle. A former druid of the Prismatic Circle, Grenhildr was excommunicated for her belief that the Great Wyrm holds the key to the world’s salvation and thus should be revived. She believed that slaying elementals would eventually wake [[Gormadraug]]. To the shock and disgust of the Circle, she sacrificed several of the druids’ elemental guardians in an unholy ritual to the Great Wyrm.

Grenhildr was chased out of Thrull, but she was not deterred. Before long, she formed her own doomsday cult. The [[Cult of the Wyrm]] now stalks the land, killing mortals and elementals alike in a bid to revive [[Gormadraug]]. The reappearance of coldfire has only emboldened them, as they see it as a sign of their master’s imminent return.
