> [!Provinces]
> Since time immemorial there have been **three** provinces in this wind blasted southern part of [[Etharis]]. Though they are now united under the banner of the Divine Arch Seraph [[Empyreus]], each province still holds notable particularities.

The southernmost nation of [[Etharis]], the Castinellan Provinces, are found on a peninsula marked by scorching winds and dry heat, reflecting the turmoil of the citizens that live there.

Castinella is composed of three main provinces: [[Toletum]], [[Faro]], and [[Therpena]]. Originally ancient enemies, the warlord Montego Valieda rose to power and united the warring provinces under the banner of the Arch Seraph [[Empyreus]]. Valieda proclaimed himself the Uniter, and those that defied him faced torture and death. 

Now a fully militaristic theocracy, Castinellans take their faith deadly seriously.

SCORCHED AND HARDENED BY THE RUTHLESS heat and wind, the people of Castinella are fierce, festive, and faithful. The southernmost part of [[Etharis]] offers both great opportunities and great challenges to those brave enough to seize them. Sailing, farming, mining, warring—nothing is outside the Castinellans’ potential, backed by the strength of their rigorous codes and passionate faith.

The teachings of the Divine [[Arch Seraphs]]— especially [[Empyreus]], Arch Seraph of Valor—have slowly but surely transformed the provinces into a militarist theocracy, with a fierce mistrust of spellcasters. But recently, new challenges to the sacred Seraphic Teachings have thrown the population into disarray. Conflict has escalated to the point where the [[Arcanist Inquisition]] has launched a crusade to burn every magically gifted being in the Castinellan Provinces... and beyond.

## Landscape
The Castinellan Provinces are a harsh land pincered between mountain and sea. It is a windswept peninsula, bounded by sea to east and west, with an irregular mountain spine running from north to south. The west coast faces the Gulf of Lions, where trade routes lead towards the city-state of [[Morencia]] and [[The Charneault Kingdom]]. The east coast is wilder and less inhabited, exposed to the strong winds from the Great Eastern Sea. 

Although the sea is never far, the provinces mostly suffer from a dry climate, due to the combined effects of constant winds and scorching heat. In that context, water has become the most precious resource, and the bigger cities have emerged on the shores of the few rivers flowing from the mountains, or, in the case of the great [[Salves River]], from the northern part of [[Etharis]].

#### The Mines of Corova
The mountain spine running north to south through Castinella has its foothills in Corova, the northern part of Castinella. There, many mining towns have emerged to exploit the numerous minerals available.

#### Faro Riverlands
In the South of Castinella, the Salves splits into two huge branches before flowing into the sea.

The land around and between the river arms is the most fertile of all Castinella, and high forests stand on the riversides wherever the land has not been cleared for farming.Vineyards of Sante ViegreIn the southernmost part of Castinella, the mountain chain abruptly breaks up into many strange mountain protrusions called the Shattered Peaks, with the Dragonborn city of Ember Cairnin their centre. Many small rivers run between these peaks, and the area, called [[Sante Viegre]], has become dense with vineyards.

## Recent Events
With the three provinces unified and a growing new state religion, the next step for the Castinellan Provinces was to turn their ambitious gaze outside, to the north and west. The city state of [[Morencia]] was reaching its apogee, so it was a valuable and challenging target for the servants of the Divine Seraph [[Empyreus]]. After a few decades of unsuccessful intrigues and power struggles, the Castinellans took up arms and launched a surprise attack on [[Morencia]]. By suborning a member of the Morencian Navigators Guild, the Castinellan fleet was able to pass through the island-city’s magical barrier, the Misty Reefs. However, the intervention of the Charneault Kingdom ruined the Castinellan plans,and though they inflicted heavy losses to the Morencian fleet, they finally lost the naval battle.

One of the ships within the defeated armada, the Fiery Lady, was cast adrift and driven far to the south, then to the east, by relentless winds. At this point, the ship had completely run out of supplies, but the crew had finally repaired the ship enough to control its course, and headed to the northwest in hope of finding landbefore they starved. But they made a surprising discovery during their approach to the coast: the submerged ruins of what seemed to be a vast complex. Unable to explore the ruins at the time, the captain noted enough information to find the ruins again in the future. Yet at that moment [[Castinellan Society]] was turned towards the future, and the clergy proclaimed the ruins nothing more than more proof of mistakes made in the past.

Some time later, however, rumours spread within Castinella that [[the Thaumaturge]], a powerful confederation of archmages, had infiltrated the Castinellan Provinces and was about to take action against the theocracy. It is unknown if the rumours had anything to do with the discovery of the ruins, or with the Castinellan Provinces’ provocative attack on [[Morencia]], but the rumours spread all over the provinces, accusing the magic-hating-theocracy of a hidden, hypocritical agenda.

These rumours were officially denied and declared heretical, a brand that extended to anyone even repeating the rumours. The [[Arcanist Inquisition]] launched the Great Purge in the provinces, redoubling their efforts to find spellcasters and, this time, to burn them. The same terrible fate also awaits anyone caught calling the Seraphic Teachings into question.
