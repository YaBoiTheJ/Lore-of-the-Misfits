**Ruler:** Countess [[Analita Von Raiza]]
**Language:** Imperial Norm
**Currency:** Bürach Crown

Liesech is a city in crisis. Once a thriving, wealthy trading hub that ruled over [[Bite Bay]], it’s being eaten alive by a mysterious and deadly disease known as [[DND/History & Cosmology/History of Liesech/The Weeping Pox]]. Despite both the Bürach Empire and the Charneault Kingdom’s efforts to contain the malady within the city, the Pox has spread to their lands.

## Strange Tides
___

The rise and fall of Liesech began with its founders, the Bouwengracht family. When Liesech was nothing more than a sleepy fishing town, the patriarch, Otto Bouwengracht, encountered a strange entity known as the Filth Gazer. The creature offered Otto a bargain: she would give him the means to turn Liesech into an immeasurably wealthy city, and in return, she would be allowed to feed from its refuse, including its dead bodies. Otto agreed, and with their contract, Liesech began to thrive. At the same time, Otto began a cult to worship and feed the creature’s bottomless hunger.

Leveraging its sea access and location between Bürach and Charneault, Liesech grew on trade and cultural influence. As the years passed, its territory expanded as it constructed a system of channels and ditches that controlled flooding and aided its merchant fleet. Soon, Liesech ships dominated the entire western [[Etharis]].

So great was the wealth that flowed into Liesech that it attracted the attention of the Bürach Empire, which desired to add this jewel to its collection. To this end, they conscripted a captive vampire, Countess [[Analita Von Raiza]], to enter Liesech and use her powers to bend the Bouwengracht family under her will. With their influence, the city would let itself be annexed by the Empire.

But the Empire had underestimated the Countess’s power and desire for vengeance. On the day of the annual celebration of the Nurturing Sea, she slaughtered the entire Bouwengracht family, a heinous crime that became known as [[the Red Morning]]. With that, Analita usurped control of the city.

## Location
___
NESTED IN THE WIDE GULF CALLED [[Bite Bay]] north of the Charneault Kingdom, the citystate of Liesech deploys its dense web of channels and ditches in a constant fight against the sea. On the city’s eastern side, an impressive fortification system relying on water once protected the city against the Bürach Empire’s ambition. On the west side, a giant harbour and arsenal face the sea.
