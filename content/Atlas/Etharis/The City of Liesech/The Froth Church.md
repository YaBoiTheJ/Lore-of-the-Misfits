The Bouwengracht family initiated and financed the [[Cult of the Sea]], a religious movement that revered the “Nurturing Sea” and made offerings in its name, in order to feed [[The Filth Grazer]]. Many churches were constructed for the cult in Liesech, but the most important is the Froth Church, the place where every Bouwengracht family member used to be buried. Built on the city’s westernmost quay, the Froth Church is in direct contact with the sea. A small channel was set up to allow passage to the waters of the bay—and to allow the secret delivery of morbid offerings to [[The Filth Grazer]]. Because of that foul visitor, the sea around the church always foams and froths, hence its name.
