[[Raevo]]

Castalore is known for its magical crafts, among the finest in [[Etharis]]. The Raevan wizards have perfected the art of golems, such that they have pioneered ways to manufacture constructs made of diamonds, orichalcum, and other exotic materials. The Shaper Guild employs the foremost crafters of magical items in [[Raevo]], constructing staves, potions, and spellbooks by the thousands each year

The fortress city of Castalore, the mageocracy of [[Raevo]] stands in opposition to [[Soma]]’s [[Crimson Court]].

Raevans built their city of Castalore with incredible foresight—they knew that they would one day be besieged, whether by an invading Bürach force or by their own countrymen, so they built their city as a fortress from its inception. Castalore sits atop a cliff and is shaped like a snake coiling upwards. High stone walls and a ten-ton steel portcullis protect the lower city. The higher one goes up the spiral, the more affluent the neighbourhood; at the very top sits Nightingale Tower, the mageocracy’s seat of power.
