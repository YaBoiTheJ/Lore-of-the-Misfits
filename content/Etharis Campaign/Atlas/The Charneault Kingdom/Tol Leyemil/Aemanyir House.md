Being an entirely elven city, only [[elves]] may enroll in [[Sarmar Academy]] proper. The exception is [[Aemanyir House]], a branch of the Academy located outside the city limits. This program was begun decades ago by an elven mage named Alren Corynthios as an experiment in teaching the elven way of magic to non-elves. Most of the Sarmar academicians consider this a waste of time, but Alrenâ€™s persistence and connections with the elven nobility have kept the school going for many years, if just barely.
