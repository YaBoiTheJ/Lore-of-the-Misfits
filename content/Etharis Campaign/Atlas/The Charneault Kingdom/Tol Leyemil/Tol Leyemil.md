# The Last Elven Free City
**Ruler:** [[Achen Elavain]]

Nestled among the southern foothills of the [[Rock-Teeth Mountains]], the most ancient elven city of [[Etharis]] stands as a monument to a proud race. Here, one can see elven architecture that predates even the Bürach Empire. It’s impossible to tell precisely how long the city has been standing, as the archives of Tol Leyemil are closed to non-elves. However, elves of all origins and subraces are welcomed and accepted here, like wandering children returning to their ancestral home. Thus, Tol Leyemil has been called the Last Free Elven City, the final stronghold of the Fair Folk.

Tol Leyemil employs an unusual system of government. The city is ruled by an elven assembly known as the [[Achen Elavain]], which is composed of members drawn from the city’s populace. While they are not part of the council, the Bondmaker shamans also have a say in the government’s decisions, as they represent the will of nature itself.

Tol Leyemil maintains an alliance with [[The Charneault Kingdom]], but relations have since soured with [[the dark elf curse]]. Racial enmity has flourished once again on both sides, affecting bilateral agreements. Some of the more radical human knights have accused the elves of tightening their supply of ore, which in turn has impacted Charneault’s supply of weapons. Meanwhile, a growing sector of elves are demanding that humans return lands they claim have been stolen from their nation. No violence has occured yet between these two sides, but with these escalating provocations that may not hold true for long.

## History 
___
The origins of the elven settlement of Caer Neiada are lost to the night of time, as is the construction date of Tol Leyemil. However, many elves claim that Tol Leyemil is the most ancient elven city on this side of the Great Sea, and the city’s impressive, convoluted, and worn-out architecture stands as proof of its immemorial age.

Detailed history of Tol Leyemil and the elves of Caer Neiada is hard to come by as the elves themselves don’t like to share their history, or indeed their city, with humans. History books probably exist in the ancient libraries of the city, but they are well guarded and no human has been allowed to visit them to this day.

Even if the Green Elves, who prefer to live in communion with raw nature, are indeed the first elven group to inhabit Caer Neiada and have been the largest population in the city until recently, Tol Leyemil has always been a cosmopolitan place.

Elves of all origins have been freely accepted and welcomed since time immemorial, and this has further reinforced the legitimacy of the political system of the city.

## Politics and Leadership
___
The city of Tol Leyemil and its surroundings are ruled by [[Achen Elavain]], which could be translated in the common tongue as The Assembly of the Elves”. It is a gathering of randomly designated elven citizens, who lead the city for a tenure of 20 years. Such a tenure is not overly-long for the elves, who can live for centuries. This system aims as much as possible to prevent personal ambitions from getting in the way of the greater good of the elven civilization.

Although not part of the [[Achen Elavain]], the shamans, especially [[Bondmakers]], are nonetheless important and influential actors in Tol Leyemil thanks to their unequalled ability to transmit the messages of nature. They are always represented in the official gatherings of the Assembly of Elves, although their opinions are strictly consultative. The Grand Shaman Aethorion is renowned even among shamans for his wisdom and foresight.

## Economy
___
Much like the humans of [[The Charneault Kingdom]], the elves rely heavily on fishing for their subsistence. Unlike the humans, however, they do not only fish in the rivers. As Tol Leyemil is a short river cruise to the sea, many fishing vessels come and go along the coast. The coast also shelters many well-maintained orchards that benefit from the temperate climate and provide heavy yields of fruits that are used for food and wines, the recipes for which are well-guarded secrets of the elven growers.

Trade between Tol Leyemil and [[The Charneault Kingdom]] used to flourish. The elves rely on Charneault cereals to feed their surging population, while humans of the Kingdom buy fruits, fine beverages, and sea fish from the elves. Though the demand still exists, things have worsened since the events of [[the Dark Elf Curse]]. Even if war has not returned, trust between elves and humans has been damaged, and trade has suffered as a result.

## Notable Persons and Locations
___
**Aethorion, Green Elf Grand Shaman** —
One of the mightiest sorcerers of his time, if not the very mightiest, Aetherion is the leader of the elven shamans, a renowned Bondmaker who walked the land for many decades. He is reputed to have the strongest connection to the [[Spirits of Nature]] ever seen, and through this to have gained the gift of foresight. His advice is given great weight by the Elven Assembly, to the continuing consternation of his main rival, Diyanthar.

**Diyanthar, Dark Elf Lord Sorcerer** — Ambitious, talented, and charismatic, Lord
Sorcerer Diyanthar acquired an influential position in record time in Tol Leyemil. Some would argue that this meteoric rise was not unrelated to his skill with the magic of mind manipulation, a controversial branch of magical studies. His insatiable curiosity led him to delve deep into forbidden magical territory and pushed him to plot and execute the treason by the Dark Elves (and other elven followers) known as [[The Dark Elf Curse]].

**Thaelkinei, the Lich Princess** — Thaelkinei was a wise and beautiful elven princess of ancient times. Only the oldest elven books contain any reference to her. In those ancient times, when the world was mainly inhabited by elves who themselves were still a young race, the elves made great progress in their insatiable search for knowledge. Thaelkinei was a sorceress who went too far in that search and disregarded the sacred bond between magic and nature.

When they discovered ways to control nature through magic, most elven sorcerers and sorceresses understood that they had found a limit that must not be crossed. To avoid catastrophe, they forbade the use of what would later be called dark magic. However, Thaelkinei was proud, even for an elf, and refused to stop studying. Her royal lineage, her thirst for power, and her deep cunning drove her to push even further. She conceived an immeasurably powerful spell, the Web of Ascendancy, that aimed not simply to control parts of nature or particular Spirits, but the entire land itself. She cast the spell from her castle of [[Tol Kerdywel]], granting herself almost godlike powers: she could change the very form of the land or control any living creature in the region of [[Tol Kerdywel]].

Only the alliance of several elven kingdoms from across the world was enough to counter the threat Thaelkinei posed, and the gathered elven sorcerers managed to create a counterspell. Even then, they could not completely overcome Thaelkinei’s spell, so instead were forced to use another even more powerful forbidden spell: the Curse of Unchanging, a powerful magical web that engulfed the area of [[Tol Kerdywel]] and bound every living thing inside in a magical sleep. It was as if time had stopped entirely, for the people, the flora, and the fauna. This terrible spell still holds in [[Tol Kerdywel]], and despite the danger, the region’s supposedly unguarded wealth has attracted the boldest adventurers.
