HIDDEN BEHIND THE MAGICAL FOREST OF [[The Grove Maze]], the Charneault Kingdom
was once a land of honour and spirituality, with a deep connection to nature. Its countless rivers, lakes, and forests are regularly engulfed in a magical mist, which hides just as many castles and fortified villages. But now it is a land of broken vows, dark tales, and terrifying creatures lurking in the night. While the last elven city of [[Tol Leyemil]] faces a coup by the Dark Elves, [[King Thibault de Sauveterre]] can barely hold the kingdom together as he seeks a cure for the curse which the treacherous Dark Elves cast on his daughter.

## Landscape
___
The Charneault Kingdom is a beautiful land nested between mountain, forest, and sea. To the northeast, a network of hills and groves called [[The Grove Maze]] cuts the kingdom off from the rest of [[Etharis]] and in particular, the Bürach. To the northwest lies the base of the Rockteeth Mountains sheltering the huge Elven city of [[Tol Leyemil]]. The kingdom’s southwest is dominated by the rocky ocean coast, inhabiting the Waterteeth, a dangerous chain of misty swamps and islands.

The wind mainly blows from the sea, driving clouds along the rivers to the north, where they hit the Rockteeth and [[The Grove Maze]]. There they fall as torrential rains, feeding the many springs and streams that flow back down towards the centre of the region.
