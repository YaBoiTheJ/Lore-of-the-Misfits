**Ruler**: Queen Andrea Helsing

[[The Valikan Tribes]]
The province of Kandar formed as a direct response to [[Thrull]]’s incursions. Seeking mutual defense against a vastly superior force, the three clans of [[Limgri]], [[Morgöng]], and [[Mithra]] banded together to create a unified front.

With the threat posed by Thrull, the remaining clans of Mithra, Limri, and Morgong banded together to defend themselves against wicked incursions. The nation of Kandar opposes the barbaric tenets of the Prismatic Circle and embraces a progressive approach to other nations. Unfortunately, Kandar does not possess the same fervent unity of Thrull; the leaders tend to bicker over everything, including how to best handle the matter of survival.

Kandar’s capital of Hrist lies in the center of Valikan
lands. Despite the strategic benefit this provides,
Kandar fights battles on many fronts. In the west, they
must deal with incursions from Thrull; to the east, they
must contend with coldfire emanating from across the
sea. Now that the Bürach Empire is making offers of
protection in exchange for some Kandar’s sovereignty,
a bitter argument has arisen among the clan leaders—
surrender part of their freedom for an alliance, or forge
ahead on their own?
The fortified city of Hrist features architecture that is
more akin to those of other nations than its own Valikan
roots. Thick stone walls and towers surround the thatched
houses and wooden buildings with steep, multi-layered
roofs. The seat of government, Hajra, features a circular
inner wall and a keep made up of several large longships
fitted one atop the other. The sails have been changed into
windmills to power the keep’s granary.
Hrist thrives on trade with other lands. Located
at the very end of the Caravan Way trade route is
Caravaner’s Rest, a sea of tents and kiosks where traders
ply their wares and hunt for bargains. Most anything
can be found and bought here—as it turns out, foreign
traders are willing to give up good money for dried
dream leaves, a powerful narcotic found only in the
mountains of Grarjord. The overwhelming demand for
this addictive substance, and the current flagging state
of Kandar’s economy, has left the government with little
choice but to control its trade through heavy taxation.
