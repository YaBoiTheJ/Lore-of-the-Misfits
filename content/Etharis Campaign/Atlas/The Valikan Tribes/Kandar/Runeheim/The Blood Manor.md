[[Runeheim]]
On the far slope of the depression that shapes the Pit, clinging to the base of Runeheim’s main wall, lies a ruined manor, yet another vestige of a prestigious but long-forgotten past. Abandoned for centuries, it is now under the control of the Blood Daggers and their mistress, the vampire Falkia Coldheart. The only access to the manor is a straight and steep road that makes it near impossible to approach without being spotted. This further reinforces the manor’s dominant position. Though it used to simply be called the Ruined Manor, it is now known as the Blood Manor.
