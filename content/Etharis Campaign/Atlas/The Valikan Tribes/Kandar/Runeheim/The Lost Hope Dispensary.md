[[Runeheim]]
On what could be considered as the main street of the Pit stands a long, flat building, faded and covered with rust. Once glorious and shining, its frontispiece is now half dismantled, but the title is still there bar one letter—passersby are left to wonder whether it is the “Last Hope” or the “Lost Hope”. Those who know what disease troubles the patients of that cursed place favor the latter version. Inside the dispensary, under the violent control of the Blood Daggers, people addicted to the Dreams Leaves are kept in a desperate state of continued intoxication, delivering a daily blood pouch for the vampire Falkia until their dying breath.
