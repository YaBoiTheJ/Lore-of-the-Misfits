At the edge of the ice bridge that links Volgen to the mainland is the fortress of the Order of Kentigern. What once was a monastery is now a high keep built to withstand a siege, with tall towers and parapets equipped with burning oil. But these defenses were not built against any mortal siege. Indeed, no army has dared to attack the fort in hundreds of years.

Rather, the Order of Kentigern is Grarjord’s first line of defense against the encroaching coldfire menace from Volgen. The ten-foot thick walls of the fortress hide catapults and trebuchets that can fire burning pitch. Ice drakes carrying bombardiers can take off in moments at the first sign of blue flame. Evoker mages can hurl fireballs from the topmost ramparts.

No effort is spared from preventing coldfire from reaching the mainland. All those within the keep know the consequences should coldfire reach the land of [[Kandar]].

### Against the Fire
Jenna raised her head from her pillow at the clanging of the bells. The alarm, which meant only one thing.

By the time she had put on her furs, Captain Hoar, her mentor and adoptive father, had assembled the squadron in the courtyard. Coldfire had been spotted near [[Cinnabar]], a fishing town twenty miles north of the Fort. The Order of Kentigern was needed once more.

Jenna pinned her lieutenants badge just in time to order them onto the ice drakes. Their mounts shook their wings and wove their necks through the air, eager for action. She ran one final check on their explosive satchels, then hauled herself onto her saddle. It was time to go.

The ice drakes leaped into the air and took flight. Within half an hour, they were within sight of [[Cinnabar]].

The coldfire had turned the town into a massive, smokeless conflagration of blue flames and icy mist. Everywhere she looked, Jenna saw people, animals, and entire houses frozen into blocks of ice. Streams of refugees were fleeing towards the hills. Some had lit bonfires and were trying to fight back the flames, to no avail.

On Captain Hoar’s orders Jenna took two squadmates to the southern part of the town. Their
goal: keep the coldfire from spreading towards [[Kandar]]. On her signal, they lit the fuses and dropped their satchels, which exploded on the tundra. After dropping a few barrels of oil, they had raised a wall of flames.

Jenna wheeled to rejoin the rest of the squadron. One look at the town below told her enough: it could not be saved. Nearly all the buildings had been sealed in ice, and despite the bombing runs the coldfire was burning higher than ever. But the ice drake saddles were empty of satchels. They had to retreat.

One of the men was signalling wildly towards something far below. A man wielding a torch stood in the town square, holding two children close to his body. They were surrounded by blue flames.

Jenna wheeled her mount for a dive, but a sharp whistle cut her short. Captain Hoar signalled her to take over the squad, then took the dive himself. He and his drake vanished behind a blanket of mist. Swallowing a painful lump in her throat, Jenna ordered the squadron to land at the outskirts where the townsfolk had gathered. There, they waited for their captain’s return.

Moments later, an ice drake hurtled out of the blue inferno, its tail and part of its jaw crusted in ice. It crashed onto the ground near the squadron. Immediately, the wizards in their number rushed forward to put out the coldfire on its scaled body with heat spells.

On the drake’s back were two children, brother and sister, their faces lined with frozen tears. Of their father and Captain Hoar, there was no sign. Days later, a funeral was held for both. Jenna was there, fighting back tears as she placed a wreath upon the rowboat that would be burned out at sea. Her captain’s insignia sparkled beneath the weak arctic sun.
