Volgen, a frozen land where originates a strange and deadly phenomenon known as coldfire. In recent years, the coldfire crisis has connected Volgen to the mainland viaan icy land bridge.

Far to the northeast, where blizzards rage and the aurora blankets the night sky, lies an icy wasteland where the coldfire rages unchecked.

Volgen is a jagged peninsular that is said to be the resting place of [[Gormadraug]]â€™s heart.

Volgen has few distinct landmarks. The land is covered entirely in jagged ice spires and outcroppings. Ice floes float on the surrounding ocean, making it treacherous for wooden ships.

Various expeditions have been sent into Volgen to investigate the coldfire phenomenon, with little success. The inhospitable terrain, the bitter cold, and the ever-present danger of a coldfire outbreak have forced each expedition to turn back or die; not many escape with their lives.

Those who have returned report seeing mysterious figures roaming the icy wastes. If it is true, how they could have survived in Volgen is a great mystery, nearly as much as the question of what they are doing there to begin with.
