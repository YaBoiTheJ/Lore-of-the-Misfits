#city_of_liesech 
At the centre of Liesech is a huge square that once served as a public forum for popular debates, while the decisions about Liesechâ€™s politics and laws were made in the tall bell tower that overlooked the square. The High Belfry was constructed centuries ago by one of the first Bouwengracht governors, and this major place of power remained under their control until [[the Red Morning]]. The centre of the city is now ruled by the [[Cult of the Veiled Woman]], and rumours say that [[Analita Von Raiza]] takes her regenerating sleep on the highest floor of the High Belfry.
