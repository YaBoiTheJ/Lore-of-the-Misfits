An astonishing piece of architecture takes centre stage in the heart of the canal network of [[Morencia]]. Originally a single bridge built above the main canal, it was the site of many trade activities. As a consequence, it was later linked to the surrounding islands by secondary bridges as the city grew larger. It finally became an improbable assembly of four bridges linked to a main bridge, vaguely in the form of a gigantic water striderâ€”hence the name.
