Toletum is the house of power in [[The Castinellan Provinces]], fueled by the mines of the [[Corova Mountains]], and home of the regionâ€™s most renowned military companies.

### Administrative Centre of the Provinces
Since the establishment of the theocracy to the glory of the Arch Seraph [[Empyreus]], Toletum has grown into a huge, industrious city that administers the affairs of all [[The Castinellan Provinces]]. Settled in a large curb of the [[ Salves]], just under the main massif of the [[Corova Mountains]], Toletum is an obligatory crossingpoint between the south of Castinella and the rest of [[Etharis]]. Merchants coming buying Castinellan goods or selling their own, official envoys, andconvoys from the three provinces all convergeon the city.

The Arch Basilica of [[Empyreus]] is the maincomplex where the rigorous laws of Castinellaare made and amended, with the commondenominator that all must follow the precepts of [[Empyreus]].

It is not a surprise that [[the Watchers of the Faithful]], a militant faction dedicated to serving the faith of the [[Arch Seraphs]], have establishedtheir headquarters in Corova. Their High Priest Nola Cirdanal is a zealous follower of [[Empyreus]] and on good terms with the Castinellan clergy, who the Watchers offer generous discounts on their service in expeditions against the enemies of the true faith.

### The Business of War
Even before the times of the Unifier, Toletum wasan industrious city that relied on metal processingand on military endeavours. The famous ToletumSquares were feared in battle for their tenacityand efficiency. Their combination of seasonedpikemen, crossbowmen, and shielded swordsmendominated battlefields for centuries, and are stillvery efficient. Many mercenary companies selltheir services in Toletum, either to the greater cause of the Castinellan theocracy or to foreign entities. They occupy huge areas outside Toletum where they train recruits, while their commercialoffices are in the city centre. This intense militaryactivity requires an equivalent weapon trade,hence the relentless work of the forges andarmouries.

As the most renowned mercenary army in [[Etharis]], the [[Company of Free Swords]] has a significant post in Toletum. However, it is not often engaged with, as the Castinellan clergy dislikes their use of wizards. The Free Swords used to benefit from exceptional treatment on this, but the situation has been tense since the beginning of the Great Purge, and the Free Swords may not maintain their presence if things escalate further.
