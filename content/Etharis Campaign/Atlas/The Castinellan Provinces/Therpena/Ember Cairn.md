## Home City of the Dragonborn
___
After uncountable years of wandering, the Dragonborn finally returned to their ancestral home of Ember Cairn. Thanks to the humility of [[Sagrado Valieda]], they were able to reconstruct their city destroyed eons ago during the [[2 Era of Expansion]].

Some legends still tell how tall the city was, perched on a high mountain, made entirely of granite. The fact that they donâ€™t agree on what exceptional cataclysm destroyed the mountain, and the city along with it, mattered not for Dragonborns, who had already turned their backs on the past. They settled in the center of the irregular and tortured mountain area known as the [[Shattered Peaks]], and built their new city to the glory of the [[Arch Seraphs]].

The highest honor was reserved for [[Empyreus]], whose impressive three-hundred-foot-tall statue occupies the main square. Once again, the city is mainly built of granite quarried from the three nearest peaks, which were slowly consumed and incorporated into the structure of the city.
