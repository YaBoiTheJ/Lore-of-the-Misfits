The third Castinellan Province, located at the southernmost tip of [[Etharis]], is known for three things: expensive fine wines, elite cavalry, and the [[Arcanist Inquisition]].

Therpena’s vineyards, located in [[Sante Viegre]], dot the temperate mountain slopes. [[Sante Viegre]] wines are prized everywhere, but the Castinellan theocracy has a monopoly on its industry. A black market for [[Sante Viegre]] wines bustles away from the Inquisition’s watchful glare.

Therpana is also home to the High Cavalry School, making Therpenan riders renowned for their racing and mounted combat. Under the tutelage of the Red Horse, Aban Dahlrum, the High Cavalry School produces unparalleled light cavalry and heavily armored coursers.

Lastly, the province of Therpena holds the Ember Cairn, the ancestral home of the dragonborn and headquarters of the [[Arcanist Inquisition]]. The [[2 Era of Expansion|Era of Expansion]] saw human armies raze the [[Ember Cairn]], driving the dragonborn from the [[Shattered Peaks]]. Years later, Valieda the Unifier returned their homeland, allowing dragonborn to rebuild the Ember Cairn. In turn, dragonborn abandoned their gods in favor of [[Empyreus]]’s teachings. Therpenan dragonborn are the most zealous inquisitors, functioning as the [[Cathedral of Embers]]’ protectors.
