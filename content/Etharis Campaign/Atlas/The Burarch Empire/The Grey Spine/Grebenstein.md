[[The Grey Spine]]
Grebenstein was once a holding of Dwarves  

One of the few remaining dwarf cities of old after the war of expansion, now primarily a mining city which covers a wide area of ore rich caves and caverns. The city itself bears no marks of human construction, as the dwarf see the human as lesser builders. Many dwarves in the city still hold a grudge against humans for the war that almost cleared them out, even though many of them only learned of the war from stories and legends passed down from their parents and grandparents.
