[[The Ostoyan Empire]]
Anyone who walks through [[Soma]] long enough will encounter a deep fissure in the earth. Those brave enough to descend find themselves in a labyrinthine ruin running throughout the land. This is the City Below, an ancient metropolis whose original name is now lost to time.

Those who brave the broken streets and ruined buildings of the necropolis will find much to discover. The entire city complex lies in a massive cave system. On the cavern ceiling dwell large glowing insects that form strange constellations. The city itself is filled with ruined buildings: temples, arenas, parks, docks, even orphanages.

But nothing lives in the City Below itself. A strange negative energy pervades the entire metropolis, sustaining its massive population of undead. Zombies, ghouls, wraiths, and ghasts abound—worse still dwell in its central districts. Few who enter the City Below leave it unchanged.

According to legend, an ancient intelligence dwells in one particular glowing shrine somewhere in the city. This entity was responsible for turning the Soman Aristocracy into vampires. One can only speculate about what further dark designs it has for Ostoya.

## The Missing
She needed to know.

Marilde stood on the edge of the shore, with her eyes on the [[Mistwall]] miles out at sea. Yesterday, a boat had come through there, bearing home nine souls who had left [[Castalore]] for the Sanctuary seven years ago.

But there were originally ten who made the journey. Of that number, her Oglaf was the one who did not return.

She had begged each one to tell her what had happened to her son. Each one would shake their head and walk away. Truly, mages loved their secrets more than their friends and family.

So be it then. If they would not tell her, she would find out herself. Marilde pushed the boat into the sea and hauled herself in. Then she began to row towards the fog.

They told her this would not work. They said she was rowing to her death, that she would perish before even reaching the isle. But what mother could stand not knowing what had become of her child? What mother would not try?

So, she rowed, and after an hour, the [[Mistwall]] hovered before her.

The water rippled and Marilde gasped, turning her head. A massive serpent emerged from the sea, its gaze as green as the shallow sea. All breath left her lungs.

It did not roar; it made no sound. It simply looked at her.

Marilde dropped to her knees in the flat-bottom boat. She tasted salt on her lips but paid it no heed. Her gaze never strayed from the green eyes of the sea serpent. Their gazes remained locked together, until some silent command drew the monster back into the deep.

When the City Watch came for her in their own rowboats, they found Marilde curled inside her own vessel, clutching her head, whispering her son’s name.
