All magic in [[Raevo]] was learned from one source—the fabled wizard academy of the [[Ravencourt Sanctuary]], located on an island southeast of [[Castalore]]. Miles from the Raevan shore, a permanent blanket of fog called the [[Mistwall]] obscures the horizon. This is the first line of defence of the island that holds the [[Ravencourt Sanctuary]]. Travelling there on your own is impossible—not only does an enchanted [[Mistwall]] hide the island, but the ocean surrounding it is also roiling with sea monsters eager to swallow intruders. The only way to get across is by invitation.

Little is known of the Sanctuary itself, and the mages who return from it will not be drawn into discussing it. All that historians have gleaned is that the Sanctuary is an academy and haven for mages. Some mages have alluded, with a longing sigh, to its vast libraries filled with tomes and spellbooks, or its laboratories with all manner of instruments primed for magical experimentation. Then they catch themselves and fall silent once more.

Until now, none have been able to uncover the secrets of the Sanctuary. Yet every seven years, like clockwork, a boat comes through the [[Mistwall]] bearing those who have graduated from the academy. Invitations to others deemed worthy are given out as well, and the boat bears them away. Of every ten candidates who go, only nine ever return. The last one, it seems, remains on the isle, and the Ravencourt wizards never reveal why this is done or the fate of those left behind. 

Those who, by accident or design, end up in the [[Mistwall]] without an invitation wind up hopelessly lost in the fog. If they linger within, they are soon beset by monstrous sea serpents. The sheer number of broken ships that wash up at [[The Dire Shore]] stands as a testament to the dangers of the [[Mistwall]].
