When the first immigrants arrived in Ostoya, they immediately staked out certain areas for their own. The Volker family chose a place where the jagged seaside cliffs gave way to a beach and a natural harbour. It was a windblown area with strange red earth which they assumed to be clay. They founded the town of Nov Ostoya and raised the [[Blackharbour]] keep by the restless sea. In time, Nov Ostoya became a hub for sea trading, fishing, and whaling. Lumberyards were erected at the nearby forests. As the roads lengthened and grew more developed, wealth began to flow into the town, which soon turned into a dense city filled with ornate towers and brooding sculptures. Nov Ostoya came to be known as the City of Gargoyles.

Nov Ostoya is a walled city, known for its tall spires, stained glass windows, pointed arches, and stone gargoyles. The tallest structure, [[Blackharbour]], is the fortress stronghold of [[Grand Duke Drago Koshevek]]. The [[Karstein Market]] serves a central hub for goods and services, but one will be hard-pressed to find weapons and armor of qualityâ€”most of these have been co-opted by the nobles for their own armies. Other places of note are the docks, where a local unit of [[The Ebon Syndicate]] operates, and a small temple devoted to [[Solyma]], goddess of righteous vengeance.
