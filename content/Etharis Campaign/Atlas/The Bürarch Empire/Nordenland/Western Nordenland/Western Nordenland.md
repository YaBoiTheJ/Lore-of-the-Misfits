West Nordenland specializes in [[Arcane Magic]]. The city of [[Erlefurt]] began as a mage college, training wizards for many years before growing into a city. A total of eight wizard schools have since arisen in [[Nordenland]], and while graduating from one is considered a great honor, [[Erlefurt]]â€™s [[Magister College]] is considered the foremost institution for arcane magic, rivalled only by [[The Ravencourt Sanctuary]] in Ostoya. Scrolls, spellbooks, and various magic items abound in the shops along [[Viternas Lane]]. Archduchess Maelfa and her magistrate focus on training more mages to cement her importance to the Imperial family and to hold the East in check.
