# The Bürarch Empire
**[[Languages]]:** Imperial Norm, Valikan, Raulish, Dwarven, and all Imperial dialects
**Currency:** Bürach Crown
Ruler: [[Emperor Aratron II]] 

NESTLED IN THE NORTHERN REGION OF [[Etharis]], the Bürach Empire presides over its domain like an old lion ravaged by illness. Once a beacon for grand civilizations everywhere, it is now a shattered nation, a nest of corrupt nobility seeking to revive old glories, lurking monsters that prey on the unwary, and desperate common folk trying to survive both.

Though it is still viewed by most of its neighbours as the political, military, and economic superpower of [[Etharis]], those within the Bürach Empire live each day with the sense that the end is near. Whether that end comes by war, cults of strange gods, rebellion, economic collapse, or the otherworldly threat of [[The Beast]], the empire is seeing its last days.

The Bürach Empire arose when four gods formed a pantheon that united the four kingdoms of [[Abendland]], [[Nordenland]], [[Rauland]], and [[Unterland]]. When the lunacy and assassination of Emperor Leopold I drove these gods mad, they killed each other in a cosmic war known as the [[Gods’ End]].

Since then, a great unease has festered in the heart of [[the Bürach people]]. Ostoya continues to threaten its eastern borders, while restive Valikan Clans challenge their power from the north. Meanwhile, an entity known as the Great Beast stalks the countryside, killing indiscriminately and creating aberrations born from nightmares. The [[Hearthkeepers]] is using all its powers to destroy the Great Beast while simultaneously suppressing all talk about it.

> “Imagine four terrified halflings standing atop each other and masquerading as a tall king, and you’ll get an idea of what the Bürach Empire is like.”
\- Ingmar Harkon, [[Erlefurt]] Grand Librarian

Still, the Bürach Empire clings to a vestige of power. It still commands the largest army in [[Etharis]], its spellcasters remain the envy of other nations, and its currency, the Bürach crown, is recognized everywhere in the continent except Ostoya.

The Bürach is divided into four distinct provinces, each separated by religious and political ties.

## Landscape
The Bürach Empire once covered the largest expanse of land of any nation in [[Etharis]]. Temperate forests abound at the northern edge, but dwindle the further one travels south as logging camps struggle to keep up with the Empire’s demand for lumber. The foothills of [[The Grey Spine]] mountain range provide a source of iron and precious gems. A major volcano, Mt. Vengeance, lies to the east of the Empire.
