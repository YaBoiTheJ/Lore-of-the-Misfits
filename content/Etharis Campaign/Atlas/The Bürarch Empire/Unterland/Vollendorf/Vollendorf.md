[[The Bürarch Empire]]
### Population:
- Approximately 2100; mostly human, some elf and half-elf.

### Vylords
Vylords function as "vicarious lords". They are persons chosen by the Lord/Lady of the province and then affirmed in an election by the citizens in the local area. If the citizens reject the Vylord selectee then another is chosen. Often times a Vylord is a notable figurehead, but sometimes they are merely a rich person who is on the good side of the Lord or Lady. Nepotism runs rampant in the political workings of [[The Bürarch Empire]] so it's often likely that most Vylords are friends and siblings of Lords or Ladies. 

Vylords typically operate at high levels within provinces but can be established to fill in as mayors/governors of cities or towns if the seat is unable to be filled in a timely manner. In all cases a Vylord outranks almost all other positions in the government. They carry with them the authority of Lord or lady who run the province. A Grand Admiral, Marshall of the Army, or Loremaster are the only other positions within the government that can overrule a Vylord on any given decision, besides the Lord or Lady themselves. Otherwise the Vylord has rank and authority above all else and is considered the equivalent to a four star General.
