[[The Grey Spine]]
The only active volcano in the Bürach Empire, Mt. Vengeance was thought to have been extinct for centuries before the [[Gods’ End]]. The energies caused by the war between the gods seem to have ignited its fires once more.

That said, something else seems to be happening deep in the bowels of the volcano. Powerful magical energies ripple from the crater, and some scholars of magic speculate that this is due to the presence of an imperial artifact.

Since these rumours started, many adventurers have tried to investigate the volcano. The few that returned bore horrific burn wounds and tales of creatures made of flame and shadow. As for the artifact, if it is there, none have seen it yet.
