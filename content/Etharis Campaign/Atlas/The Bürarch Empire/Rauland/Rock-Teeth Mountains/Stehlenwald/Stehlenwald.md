[[Rock-Teeth Mountains]]
The great tiered city of Stehlenwald is the biggest jewel in dwarven architecture. After the war of expansion, this is the last true hold without any influence from human hands. [[The Quartz Palace]] at the topmost level of Stehlenwald remains one of the wonders of [[The Bürarch Empire]].

It looks like a celestial stairway carved from granite and marble adorned with statues

Despite its perennial bustle, a pall hangs over Stehlenwald. Its once majestic buildings are covered in soot, and its weary-eyed citizens stare blankly from their windows at newcomers. Workers trudge joylessly from their shops to their home. And at nightfall, the bells toll to warn others not to loiter after dark. Despite these warnings, guards often find yet another body in the gutter with its face and skin flayed off—the leavings of [[The Beast]] and its monstrous spawn.
