#province 
Province of [[The Bürarch Empire]]
**Ruler:** Archduke Ulrich Eisenherz

Found in the southernmost part of the Empire, Rauland is ruled by an authoritarian
government that believes in order and structure above all things. The Raulfolk are masters at crafting great stone buildings and unmatched weaponry. Yet despite a government that prides itself in complete control, Raulish society is fraying under the threat of [[The Beast]].

As visitors enter Rauland, they notice lumber yards stretching across denuded hills and plains. Eventually, they spy a dark cloud hovering over the mountains of Hermansdatt, only to realize it is a dense plume of smoke from the city on the slopes. This is [[Stehlenwald]], crown jewel of Rauland.

Rauland is the seat of the Empire’s arms and crafts industry. People from all over the continent come to [[Stehlenwald]] in hopes of learning from its schools of architecture, woodwork, stonecraft, and most of all, smithing. The fortunate few who show talent (and the majority with good social connections) may apprentice under a maestro, eventually founding their own shop in Rauland or elsewhere. Such a craftsperson would find themselves in great demand all over the continent.

The loss of the god [[Galt]] has brought down the quality of Raulish goods but has not completely tarnished their reputation. Rauland still leads [[Etharis]] in terms of craft skill and raw materials. At the [[Stehlenwald Grand Market]], buyers have a choice of fine steel weapons, armor, jewelry, and sundry items—all well crafted and equally expensive.

## History
Rauland began as a thanedom of dwarves and gnomes living within the mountain range called the Rock Teeth mountains, or Hermansdatt in their native tongue. For millennia, these underground dwellers lived in contentment, forging their jewelry and weapons.

In time [[Galt]], the god of order, found them and called them out of the mountains. “You will be my people,” he decreed. “You will show all the world what it means to live in perfect harmony and enlightenment, that all may walk the path of the righteous.”

So hearing, the dwarves and gnomes built a great city on the mountainside. Named [[Stehlenwald]], the city resembles a celestial stairway carved from granite and marble and adorned with statues—a feat of architecture and engineering unrivalled throughout the land. [[The Quartz Palace]] at the topmost level of [[Stehlenwald]] remains one of the wonders of [[The Bürarch Empire]].

The Bürach came to rely on the craftsmanship of the Raulfolk. Thousands came to the Raulish guilds to learn carpentry, smithing, architecture, and construction. The forge fires of [[Stehlenwald]] burned for centuries as the Raufolk created great buildings and fashioned weapons for trade with the other provinces.

When madness fell upon [[Galt]], he demanded nothing less than complete order. In taskmaster fashion, he commanded that everything run on time, for products to be made and sold like clockwork. Buildings continued to rise, weapons were forged by the thousands and shipped across the land, and the people worked like slaves. No one was allowed to rise above their station or to leave the province.

As [[Galt]]’s paranoia worsened, he began to police the minds of his followers. The watchmen patrolled the streets and monitored the city from watchtowers. Those that ever voiced a whisper of dissent were imprisoned—sometimes put to death.

Unable to stand this madness any longer, a handful of Raulish sages made a pact with the other provinces. The Raulfolk secretly forged daggers that would be undetectable to the seers of the Imperial Palace. Thus, assassins were able to steal into the imperial palace and kill Emperor Leopold.

Though they were freed from their mad god, life only marginally improved for the Raulfolk. Their wares remain popular throughout the Empire, but without [[Galt]]’s guidance their craft began to decline in potency over the years. Border disputes with [[Unterland]] arose, and their need for timber led to conflict with nearby [[Nordenland]].

Worst of all, something now stalks the Raulish countryside and the smog-ridden streets of the capital--something that turns citizens into monstrosities that prey on the innocent.

Though the guards keep watch all night, the threat has not abated. [[The Beast]] haunts the Raulfolk, and thus far none have been able to stop it.

## Economy
[[Stehlenwald]]’s main trade is in metalworks including jewelry, tools, and above all, weaponry. The excellence of their products comes from more than their choice of raw materials and system for folded steel; the Raulfolk have honed their craft into an art form, something that can only be replicated by magic. Raulish weapons hold an edge better and endure longer than others made by lesser smiths.

Nowadays, their economy is on a downturn due to the decline in their weapon quality, from what it once was. Worse, the thick, acrid smoke from the forges has harmed the health and quality of life in the city. Yet, though Raulish weapons no longer live up to their legendary status, armies still require them for the wars along the eastern border. The Raulfolk take what business they can get.

## Notable Individuals
**Arch Duke Ulrich Eisenherz** — The dwarven thane of Rauland. A fair-minded and well-loved ruler of the province, he is nevertheless hounded by rumours that he holds one of the imperial artifacts, the [[Hearthfire Breastplate]], in his vault. He has continued to deny this, though an inquiry has been launched by the [[Hearthkeepers]]. Most speculate that the duke does not want to raise the ire of the Holy Church, or that he is biding his time to use the artifact. With the ongoing attacks of [[The Beast]], that time may be nigh.

**Artom Drago** — Faced with a mind-bending horror such as [[The Beast]], some Raulfolk have chosen to fight monsters with monsters. Drago, a former agent of Rauland, was disavowed by his own government so that he could undertake a secret mission. Infecting himself and his men with lycanthropy, Drago and his pack roam the countryside at night, hunting down [[The Beast]]’s creations and tearing them to shreds.

While they have been initially successful, the Norden government fears that Drago and his men are starting to lose themselves to their wolfish natures. If true, they would have to be put
down as well.
